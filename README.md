## Mission Statement
To leverage artificial intelligence, computer vision, and innovative road threat detection to make traveling safer.


## Our Goal
To bring the safety features of self-driving car technology to everyone across the socio-economic spectrum.
## Market
The common driver and commuter.

## Features
Analyzes historical accident data and patterns, traffic density, weather, and more to alert and warn the driver of potential risks ahead of time.


## Tech Stack 
**Front-end:** Javascript (React)\
**Back-end:** Python (with OpenCV)\
**Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend)\
**APIs:** ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo (OpenAI), OpenWeather, Google Maps

## Detecting Safety
We are using two separate algorithms that determine whether or not the road will be accident prone, warning the user if so.
One algorithm uses ML that uses images from the phone that has been trained from images that accidents have occured, and the other
uses API calls using road conditions that determines if the weather or road conditions are dangerous to drive on.
